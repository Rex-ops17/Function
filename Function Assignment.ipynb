        "\"\"\" (1)  A function in Python is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. It can be defined independently of any object or class. Functions are defined using the def keyword, and they can be called by simply using their name and passing arguments (if required).\n",
        "         A method, however, is a function that is bound to an object and defined inside a class. Methods work on the data of the object to which they are bound and are invoked by using an instance of the class. The first argument passed in calling a method is the object to which it is bound (commonly known as self). Functions are not class members, and methods are class members that modify the attributes of an object.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\"\"\" (2)  Parameters are the variables declared in the function definition. They indicate what type of values the function expects to receive when invoked. In other words, parameters are placeholders used in the function signature to receive values.\n",
        "         Arguments are the values that are sent to the function when it is called. They constitute the data of which the function performs its tasks. Parameters and arguments are normally used synonymously, but to be more formal, parameters pertain to variables within the definition of a function, whereas the argument refers to the values submitted to the function.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"\"\"(3) Different ways of Definition and Call to a Function of Python:\n",
        "          1-Simple functions are defined with the def keyword and perform specific tasks.\n",
        "          2-Functions with default arguments allow you to set default values for parameters, making the function more flexible.\n",
        "          3-Functions with variable arguments (*args, **kwargs) allow the function to accept a flexible number of positional and keyword arguments.\n",
        "          4-Lambda functions are anonymous, small functions used for simple tasks.\n",
        "          5-Recursive functions call themselves to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller instances.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\"\"\" (4) The return statement in a function is used to exit the function and send back a result or value to the caller. It terminates the function's execution and provides the output. Without a return statement, the function returns None by default.\n",
        "        The purpose of return is to allow functions to output data, making it possible to use the result in further computations or operations.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\"\"\" (5) Iterable: Any object in Python that could return an iterator is called an iterable. Anything that can be used in a for loop is an iterable.\n",
        "        An iterator is an object that presents a stream of data. The difference between an iterator and an iterable is that an iterator has memory for its current position, and it can be iterated using the next() function. It generates an iterator from an iterable to work through its items one by one.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\"\"\" (6) A generator is a special type of iterator that lets you iterate over data one item at a time but does not store all values in memory at once, as with lists or tuples.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\"\"\" (7) Memory Efficiency: Generators only produce one item at a time and do not store the entire sequence in memory.\n",
        "        Lazy Evaluation: Generators enable lazy evaluation. This means that values are generated only when they are needed. This may improve performance and avoid unnecessary computations.\n",
        "        State Preservation: Because generators preserve their state between yield calls, they can resume their execution from where they left off, which makes them useful for creating iterative processes without recalculating previous steps.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\"\"(8) A lambda function in Python is an anonymous function defined using the keyword lambda. It can take any number of input parameters but has only one expression.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\"\"\" (9) Map() function of Python applies a given function to all items in an iterable and returns an iterator that yields results. It is particularly helpful in transforming or processing each element in an iterable without explicitly writing a loop.\"\"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\"\"\" (10) map(): The map() function applies a given function to all items in an iterable and returns an iterator with the results. It is used when you want to apply a transformation to each item in an iterable.\n",
        "         reduce(): The reduce() function from the functools module applies a binary function  cumulatively to the items in an iterable, from left to right, to reduce the iterable to a single value. It is often used for operations like summing, multiplying, or concatenating values.\n",
        "         filter(): The filter() function filters elements from an iterable based on a function that returns True or False for each element. It returns an iterator containing only those elements for which the function returned True.\"\"\"\n",
